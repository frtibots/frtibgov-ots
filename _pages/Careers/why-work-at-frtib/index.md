## Why work at FRTIB

The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is widely considered to be one of the best retirement plans in the world and a model for defined contribution plans. We are seeking a champion for its continual improvement. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is an independent federal agency responsible for administering the TSP. We help federal employees and members of the uniformed services retire with dignity by providing benefits similar to private sector 401(k) plans.

To administer the TSP solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.

### Core Values:
Participant-Focused, Integrity, Collaboration

### Flexible Work:  
FRTIB offers flexible work schedules that give our employees options to balance agency and employee and needs.
### Benefits:
We provide our employees with a first-class benefit package, including health insurance, life insurance, retirement, 11 paid holidays per year, vacation time, and more! In addition, we offer training/career development opportunities, flexible work schedules, and an on-site fitness center.
