## Federal Orientation Materials

The morning of your report date will be filled with activities to in-process you into our agency.  You will receive your Oath of Office, receive briefings from various program offices and a tour of our workspace.  To help orient you to the agency we have gathered information to support the new hire experience.  Information contained in this section will help acclimate you to the agency with topics ranging from the dress code to the agencyâ€™s strategic vision.  Contact your supervisor or your HR Specialist POC if you have additional questions.
