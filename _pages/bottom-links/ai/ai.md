The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB, or the Agency) is taking steps to enhance its governance, innovation, and risk management for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This signifies a meaningful step toward effective AI implementation in the Agency’s operations.

#### STRENGTHENING AI GOVERNANCE
FRTIB is committed to strengthening AI governance through the use of governance bodies, policies and procedures as well as an overarching strategy. Additionally, FRTIB maintains an [AI Use Case Inventory](https://www.frtib.gov/data/ai_inventory/){:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

#### ADVANCING EFFECTIVE AI INNOVATION

FRTIB plans to leverage the NIST’s AI Risk Management framework to implement AI services in a secure and effective way. The Agency will utilize existing governance processes to identify innovative AI uses and work together with other internal governance bodies to ensure effective AI use.

#### MANAGING RISKS FROM THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Leveraging the NIST AI Risk Management Framework as a guide, the Agency is focusing on developing an AI strategy, building out policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate risks. This combination of policies, processes, governance activities, and risk mitigation is aimed at ensuring safe and reasonable AI deployment and use at FRTIB.
